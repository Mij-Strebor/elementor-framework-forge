Professional management interface for Elementor Version 4 (atomic widget architecture) assets — Variables, Classes, and Components.

== Description ==

Elementor Framework Forge (EFF) is a WordPress plugin that provides a professional management interface for Elementor Version 4 (atomic widget architecture) assets.

EFF allows developers to organize, edit, and persist the three core asset types introduced by Elementor v4:

* **Variables** — CSS custom properties used by atomic widgets
* **Classes** — Developer-defined class names applied to atomic widget controls (EFF v3)
* **Components** — User-assembled widgets built within Elementor v4 (EFF v4)

**Requires Elementor and Elementor Pro.**

=== Key Features (Beta 0.3.0) ===

* **Sync from Elementor** — Reads the Elementor V4 kit CSS file and imports CSS variables automatically. Sync options dialog: "Sync by name" or "Clear and replace".
* **Versioned backup system** — Every Save Project creates a timestamped snapshot; restore any backup from the two-level project/backup picker. Up to 50 backups per project (configurable).
* **Multi-project support** — Multiple independent named projects per WordPress site.
* **Commit to Elementor** — Write modified variable values back to the active kit CSS. Commit summary shows modified / new / deleted counts before writing.
* **Elementor V3 Global Colors import** — Import V3 system and custom colors into EFF as color variables.
* **Export / Import** — Download the current project as a portable `.eff.json` file; import on any WordPress site running EFF.
* **Four-panel interface** — Top menu bar, collapsible left navigation tree, center edit space, right data management panel.
* **Project organization** — Variables organized into Colors / Fonts / Numbers. Categories are user-configurable per set.
* **Color picker** — Visual Pickr color picker (HEX / RGB / HSL + alpha) with live palette refresh.
* **Tint / shade / transparency generator** — Generate up to 10 tints, 10 shades, and 9 transparency variants per color variable.
* **Light / Dark mode** — Per-user theme preference, persisted to WordPress usermeta.

=== Architecture ===

EFF is built for future portability. The data layer contains no WordPress dependencies and is designed to be ported to a standalone Windows or Mac application in a future phase.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Ensure **Elementor** and **Elementor Pro** are installed and active
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Navigate to **EFF** in the WordPress admin sidebar

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does EFF modify my Elementor CSS files? =

Not by default. EFF is read-first and non-destructive — it reads your Elementor kit CSS but never modifies it unless you explicitly click **↑ Variables** (Commit to Elementor) in the right panel. A summary dialog shows exactly what will be written before you confirm.

= Where are .eff.json files stored? =

In your WordPress uploads directory under `/uploads/eff/`.

= What Elementor version is required? =

Elementor v4+ (atomic widget architecture) and Elementor Pro.
