|---|---|
| **New to EFF?** | **[Quick Start Guide →](QUICK-START.md)** — from zero to an organized project in about ten minutes |
| **Looking up a feature?** | **[User Manual →](USER-MANUAL.md)** — complete reference for every panel and workflow |

> **LytBox Academy testers:** Start with the Quick Start Guide. It covers installation through your first saved project and explains every part of the interface.

## What is EFF?

Elementor Framework Forge (EFF) is a WordPress developer tool that gives you a purpose-built management interface for the CSS custom properties introduced by **Elementor Version 4** (the new atomic widget architecture).

Instead of hunting through Elementor's generated CSS by hand, EFF reads your kit file, organizes your variables into labeled categories, and lets you manage them as a structured, multi-project workspace with full backup and version history.

**EFF is a read-first, non-destructive tool.** It never modifies Elementor's CSS unless you explicitly commit changes back.

---

## Data Management Model

EFF manages Elementor V4 assets through four distinct, user-controlled data channels. All controls live in the **right panel**.

| Channel | Into EFF | Out of EFF |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Elementor V4 Sync** | Pull variables from Elementor kit | Commit EFF variables back to Elementor kit |
| **Elementor V3 Import** | Import V3 Global Colors into current project | Not supported — V3 is read-only |
| **Backup / Restore** | Restore a saved project snapshot | Save Project — creates a timestamped backup |
| **External File** | Import an `.eff.json` from disk | Export current project to `.eff.json` |

**The only automatic operation is startup auto-load** — EFF reloads the last active project when you open the plugin. Everything else is user-initiated.

---

## Beta Status

This is **Beta 0.3.2** — distributed exclusively to LytBox Academy members. The complete Variables workflow is fully functional and ready for systematic testing. Classes and Components management are planned for future phases.

Please report issues in the LytBox Academy community. Your feedback directly shapes the next release.

![EFF Numbers](docs/images/numbers.png)

**Four panels:**
- **Top bar** — Preferences, Manage Project, Functions, History, Search, Help
- **Left nav** — Collapsible tree: Variables (Colors / Fonts / Numbers) · Classes *(Phase 3)* · Components *(Phase 4)*
- **Center edit space** — Category blocks, variable rows, inline editing
- **Right panel** — All data management: active project, save & backups, Elementor sync, V3 import, export/import

---

## Requirements

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| WordPress | 5.8 or later |
| PHP | 7.4 or later |
| Elementor (free) | Latest recommended |
| Elementor Pro | Latest recommended |

> Both **Elementor** and **Elementor Pro** must be installed and active. EFF shows an admin notice and refuses to load if either is missing.

---

## Installation

### Option A — Clone (recommended for testers)

```bash
cd wp-content/plugins
git clone https://github.com/Mij-Strebor/elementor-framework-forge.git
```

Activate **Elementor Framework Forge** in **WordPress → Plugins → Installed Plugins**.

### Option B — Download ZIP

1. Click **Code → Download ZIP** on this page.
2. Unzip into `wp-content/plugins/elementor-framework-forge/`.
3. Activate in WordPress.

### Option C — Development Symlink (Windows)

From an **elevated** Command Prompt:

```cmd
mklink /D "C:\path\to\wp\wp-content\plugins\elementor-framework-forge" "E:\path\to\your\eff"
```

macOS / Linux:
```bash
ln -s /path/to/eff /path/to/wp/wp-content/plugins/elementor-framework-forge
```

---

## Quick Start

> ### [Read the Quick Start Guide →](QUICK-START.md)
>
> The Quick Start walks through installation, syncing variables, organizing into categories, saving your project, and using the backup system. Takes about ten minutes.

The short version:

1. Activate the plugin and open **EFF** in the WordPress admin sidebar.
2. In the right panel under **Elementor Sync**, click **↓ Variables** to pull your variables from Elementor.
3. Variables appear under **Colors**, **Fonts**, and **Numbers** in the left panel.
4. Click any category to open it in the edit space. Edit values inline; click a swatch to open the color picker.
5. Click **Save Project** in the right panel to create your first backup snapshot.

---

## Project File Format

EFF stores projects in `uploads/eff/{project-slug}/` as timestamped `.eff.json` snapshots:

```
uploads/eff/
  my-brand/
    my-brand_2026-03-19_14-30-00.eff.json
    my-brand_2026-03-19_16-45-12.eff.json
  client-theme/
    client-theme_2026-03-18_09-00-00.eff.json
```

The format is plain JSON — portable between installations and designed to support a future desktop application.

```

### Design Principles

**Non-destructive by default.** EFF reads Elementor's CSS and never modifies it unless you click **Commit to Elementor**. Your Elementor configuration is always the source of truth until you deliberately push changes back.

**User-controlled data flow.** Every sync, commit, export, import, save, and restore is an explicit user action. The only automatic operation is reloading the last active project on startup.

**Platform-portable data layer.** `EFF_Data_Store` contains zero WordPress dependencies in its core methods. The data layer is designed to be ported to a standalone desktop application in a future phase.

**No build step.** All JavaScript is ES5 IIFE — no webpack, no transpiler, no `npm install`. The plugin works by dropping files into WordPress.

- **PHP** — WordPress hooks, AJAX handlers, CSS parsing, post meta scanning
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES5)** — No jQuery for EFF UI logic; `fetch()` for all AJAX; no build step
- **CSS Custom Properties** — Full design token system; light/dark mode via `[data-eff-theme]`
- **Pickr v1.9.0** — Visual color picker (CDN); classic theme; HEX / RGB / HSL + alpha
